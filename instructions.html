			<h1>Echo Maze</h1>
			<p>Use W, A, S, D to move.</p>
			<p>To send out a ping, click and drag in the direction that you want to ping. (The starting point and the length of the drag are not important, only the angle).</p>
			<p>You will hear a tone when your ping goes out and when it encounters an obstacle. Use the time between these pings to figure out the distance to an obstacle in that direction.</p>
			<p>If the pitch of the response ping is lower, then your ping has reached a wall. If the pitch is higher, however, you have found your goal!</p>
			<p>If you walk into an obstacle, you will here a muffled, lower tone.</p>
